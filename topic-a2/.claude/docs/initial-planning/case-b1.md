# Case B1: Hemisphere Stratification — Phase Symmetry Test

> **Verdict: KEEP — highest priority novel case**

## Motivation

The literature attributes seasonal seismicity to hemisphere-specific hydrological loading (monsoon in Nepal, snowpack in Japan and California). If hydrology drives the equinox signal, the Northern and Southern Hemispheres should be approximately 6 months out of phase with each other (opposite seasons). If the signal reflects a solar-geometric mechanism symmetric across hemispheres (equinox geometry affects both hemispheres identically and simultaneously), both hemispheres should peak at the same solar phase positions.

## Test

Split the catalog into Northern Hemisphere (latitude > 0°) and Southern Hemisphere (latitude < 0°) subsets. Compute solar-phase bin distributions independently for each. Test whether the equinox excess appears at the same phase positions in both hemispheres or at positions 0.5 cycles apart.

## Novel Contribution

No published study has applied this specific phase-symmetry test to a global M >= 6.0 catalog to discriminate between hydrological and geometric solar forcing. This directly addresses whether the equinox signal is a global solar-geometric effect or a superposition of two hemisphere-specific hydrological effects.

## Predictions

- **Geometric hypothesis:** Both hemispheres peak at the same two equinox positions.
- **Hydrological hypothesis:** NH and SH peaks are offset by ~half a year.
