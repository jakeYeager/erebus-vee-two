# Academic Research: Solid-Earth Tidal Triggering and Annual Periodicity of Large Earthquakes

**Research Question:** Do solid-earth tides act as triggering mechanisms for large earthquakes (M>=6.0), and do large earthquakes show any annual periodicity?

## 1. Tidal Triggering: Evidence from Global Catalogs and Magnitude Dependence

The foundational evidence for solid-earth tidal triggering rests on large-catalog statistical studies, but these consistently show that the effect is strongest at small magnitudes and weakest — or absent — at large magnitudes (M>=6).

**Métivier, de Viron, Conrad et al. (2009)** (*Earth and Planetary Science Letters*, 278(3-4), 370-375) demonstrated that:

- Using 442,412 earthquakes from the NEIC catalog, a correlation exists at approximately 99% confidence between the phase of the solid Earth tide and earthquake timing.
- Earthquakes occur slightly more often during ground uplift (when normal stresses are reduced), with a probability increase of approximately 0.5 to 1.0%.
- The phase distribution anomaly is **larger for smaller and shallower earthquakes**, establishing an inverse magnitude dependence of tidal sensitivity.
- No statistically significant focal mechanism dependence was found, though normal and strike-slip regions showed slightly greater triggering than thrust regions.
- The triggering is attributed to solid Earth tides rather than ocean or atmospheric loading.

**Tanaka (2010)** (*Geophysical Research Letters*, 37, L02301) demonstrated that:

- Tidal triggering of earthquakes was observed in the precursory period (several to ten years) **before** the three Sumatra megathrust earthquakes (Mw 9.0, 8.6, 8.5).
- The frequency distribution of tidal phase angles showed a peak near the angle of maximum tidal shear stress accelerating fault slip.
- This precursory tidal correlation was interpreted as a physical consequence of tidal stress change on faults approaching critical failure.

**Ide, Yabe, and Tanaka (2016)** (*Nature Geoscience*, 9(11), 834-837) demonstrated that:

- The fraction of large earthquakes increases (the Gutenberg-Richter b-value decreases) as the amplitude of tidal shear stress increases.
- Very large earthquakes including the 2004 Sumatra (Mw 9.0), 2010 Maule (Mw 8.6), and 2011 Tohoku-Oki (Mw 9.0) occurred near times of maximum tidal stress amplitude.
- For earthquakes **below approximately M 8.2, distributions were indistinguishable from random sampling.**
- The implication is that tidal stress does not trigger individual large earthquakes but may increase the probability that a small nucleation grows into a large rupture.

## 2. Critique and Replication Failures of Tidal Triggering Claims

Recent systematic replication efforts have raised serious concerns about the robustness of published tidal triggering correlations, particularly for large earthquakes.

**Bradley and Hubbard (2024)** (*Earthquake Insights*, multi-part analysis) demonstrated that:

- Replication of Tanaka et al. (2002) methods on post-2000 data showed that **in no case was a low p-value from the pre-2000 dataset replicated in the post-2000 dataset**, suggesting original findings may be statistical artifacts.
- Replication of Cochran et al. (2004) showed the signal weakened dramatically in post-2001 data; switching from centroid to origin earthquake locations caused the effect to essentially vanish.
- For Ide et al. (2016), earthquakes below M 8.2 show distributions indistinguishable from random, and methodological artifacts were identified rather than physical tidal triggering.
- Tidal asymmetry creates approximately 20% phase distribution bias unrelated to earthquake triggering, potentially generating false positives in Schuster test analyses.
- Aftershock temporal clustering can produce artificial tidal correlations: aftershocks cluster at a particular tidal phase simply because they follow the mainshock closely in time.

**Hough (2018)** (*Seismological Research Letters*, 89(2A), 577-581) demonstrated that:

- Analysis of 204 earthquakes of M>=8 dating back to the 1600s found **no evidence** that great earthquakes occur on preferred days of the calendar year or lunar cycle.
- Observed patterns were "no different from the kinds of patterns you would get if the data are completely random."
- The highest concentration (16 earthquakes at 7 days after new moon) lacked statistical significance and contradicted physical expectations since lunar tides are minimal at that phase.

## 3. Precursory Tidal Sensitivity as a Fault-State Indicator

A distinct line of evidence treats tidal sensitivity not as a triggering mechanism for mainshocks but as a diagnostic of fault zone criticality.

**Beauce, Bowden, and Yoshioka (2023)** (*Geophysical Research Letters*, 50, e2023GL104375) demonstrated that:

- A comprehensive 10-year earthquake catalog preceding the 2019 M7.1 Ridgecrest earthquake showed enhanced tidal sensitivity of microseismicity starting approximately 1.5 years before the mainshock.
- The tidal modulation signal became "extremely strong" after 2018, specifically along faults that broke in the M7.1 event.
- Stress amplitudes of only kilopascals (from tides) became mechanically significant as the fault zone approached instability.
- The authors explicitly stated that **this does not mean tidal stresses triggered the earthquake**; rather, evolving fault zone properties made the crust more responsive to tidal forcing.

**Scholz, Tan, and Albrecht (2019)** (*Nature Communications*, 10, 2526) demonstrated that:

- At Axial Volcano on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, approximately 60,000 earthquakes (Mc = 0.1) showed clear tidal modulation with no magnitude dependence.
- No stress threshold was found; even extremely small tidal stresses modulated seismicity rates.
- The viscous friction parameter A was approximately 0.0003, an order of magnitude smaller than laboratory measurements, cautioning against applying lab friction values to geological settings.
- This environment (shallow, volcanic, near mid-ocean ridge) is distinct from continental fault zones and large tectonic earthquakes.

## 4. Annual and Seasonal Periodicity in Large Earthquake Occurrence

Evidence for annual or seasonal periodicity in large earthquakes is sparse and contested for global datasets, but a few specific populations show suggestive patterns.

**Zhan and Shearer (2015)** (*Geophysical Research Letters*, 42, 7366-7373) demonstrated that:

- Of 60 large deep-focus earthquakes (M > 7.0, depth > 500 km) from 1900 to 2015, **42 (70%) occurred in the middle half of the calendar year (April–September).**
- Seasonality was strongest in northwest Pacific subduction zones and weakest in Tonga.
- **Smaller deep earthquakes showed no seasonality**, establishing magnitude dependence in the *opposite* direction from tidal triggering (larger events more seasonal).
- The authors could not rule out that the pattern is random chance, due to ex post facto hypothesis testing and no known physical mechanism for seasonal forcing at depths > 500 km.

**Johnson, Fu, and Burgmann (2017)** (*Science*, 356(6343), 1161-1164) demonstrated that:

- Seasonal hydrological loading in California modestly modulates seismicity rates using 9 years of GPS vertical deformation data.
- The effect applies to small earthquakes; the study used microseismicity catalogs and did not extend to M>=6.

**Dutilleul, Johnson, and Burgmann (2021)** (*Geophysical Research Letters*, 48, e2020GL089673) demonstrated that:

- Near Parkfield, California, **shallow earthquakes (depth <= 7.2 km) show semiannual periodicity**, while deeper earthquakes show no semiannual and only weak annual periodicity.
- Peak-trough months in the periodic signal differ between pre-2004 and post-2006 time spans, suggesting the periodicity is modulated by changing fault conditions following the 2004 Parkfield M6.0 earthquake.

## 5. Multi-Year and Orbital Periodicities in Global M>=6 Seismicity

**Zaccagnino, Vespe, and Doglioni (2024)** (*Scientific Reports*, 14, 3704) demonstrated that:

- Earth plate boundaries exhibit both short-period (semidiurnal, diurnal, fortnightly) and long-period (semiannual, annual, pole wobble) seismicity modulation.
- Stable plate interiors lack short-period modulation but respond to long-period forcing.
- A gravity-induced resonance destabilization model, based on rate-and-state friction, explains the diversity of modulation patterns across Earth, Moon, and Mars.

**Riguzzi, Ouzounov, Bui et al. (2025)** (*Frontiers in Earth Science*, 13, 1587650) demonstrated that:

- Analysis of **124 years of M>=6.0 earthquake counts** identified seven periodic components from 1 to approximately 60 years that reconstruct the seismicity signal to approximately 90%.
- Periodicities around 5, 7, 8, 11, 14, 18, 20, and 40 years align with planetary orbital resonances (Laplace commensurabilities).
- The proposed mechanism operates through solid Earth–hydrosphere interactions (water-rock interactions modulating stress) rather than direct gravitational tidal forcing.

## Summary Table

| Finding | Evidence | Relevance to Project |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| Solid-earth tidal triggering is real but small (~0.5–1% probability increase) | Métivier et al. (2009): 442,412 events, 99% confidence | Establishes tidal forcing produces a detectable but tiny signal in earthquake timing |
| Tidal triggering effect is **stronger for small, shallow earthquakes**; absent at M>=6 | Métivier et al. (2009), Ide et al. (2016): M<8.2 indistinguishable from random | For project's M>=6 dataset, diurnal/semidiurnal tidal triggering is unlikely to produce significant signal |
| Published tidal correlations often fail replication on independent data | Bradley & Hubbard (2024): no pre-2000 result replicated post-2000 | Methodological caution needed; aftershock contamination and location choices bias results |
| M>=8 earthquakes show no calendar-day or lunar-cycle preference | Hough (2018): 204 events, pattern indistinguishable from random | Direct evidence against annual periodicity driven by tidal cycles at large magnitude |
| Large deep-focus earthquakes (M>7, depth>500 km) show suggestive seasonality (70% in Apr–Sep) | Zhan & Shearer (2015): 42 of 60 events | Intriguing but no known physical mechanism; smaller deep events show no seasonality |
| Regional seasonal modulation documented but limited to microseismicity | Johnson et al. (2017), Dutilleul et al. (2021) | Annual periodicity limited to small events in regions with strong seasonal water loading |
| Multi-year periodicities (5–60 yr) in M>=6 counts align with planetary orbital resonances | Riguzzi et al. (2025): 124 years, ~90% signal reconstruction | Suggests long-period forcing through hydrological intermediaries; annual sub-signal implied |
| Tidal sensitivity increases as faults approach failure | Beauce et al. (2023), Tanaka (2010) | Tidal sensitivity is a fault-state diagnostic, not a direct triggering mechanism for individual large events |

The body of evidence collectively establishes that while solid-earth tides produce a statistically detectable modulation of global seismicity, this effect is strongest for small, shallow earthquakes and **diminishes toward irrelevance at M>=6.0**. For large earthquakes, tidal phase shows no robust correlation that survives replication on independent datasets. Annual or seasonal periodicity in large earthquakes is documented only in narrow populations (deep-focus M>7) or regionally where hydrological loading provides a clear mechanism. The project's investigation of seasonal clustering in M>=6 global seismicity is therefore operating in territory where **the literature offers no established mechanism and no confirmed prior signal** — which both strengthens the novelty of the prior Case 3A finding and raises the methodological bar for claiming significance.
