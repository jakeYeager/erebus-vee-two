# Project Scope

The purpose of this project to begin to formally describe and document novel seismic phenomena observations using rigorous, reproducible statistical validation. It is also to explore how to leverage generative AI tools for academic research in the seismology and data analysis domain.

## Topics of Interest
1. Gutenberg-Richter power law at global scale
2. Inter-event time distribution
3. Seasonal clustering correlated with solar orbital position
4. Magnitude-independence of seasonal effect
5. Blind study validation
6. General cognitive biases (i.e. confirmation bias, hypothesis bias)
