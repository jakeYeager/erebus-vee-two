# Project Scope

The purpose of this project to begin to formally describe and document novel seismic phenomena observations using rigorous, reproducible statistical validation. It is also to explore how to leverage generative AI tools for academic research in the seismology and data analysis domain.

## Data Analysis Approaches

Each approach in this project focuses on refining the analysis perspectives and verifying the dataset's integrity.
