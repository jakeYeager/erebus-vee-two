# Case B4: Depth Stratification — Surface Loading Penetration Test

> **Verdict: REFRAME — now has stronger positive motivation**

## Motivation

Hydrological and thermoelastic loading primarily affects the shallow crust (< 20 km). Intermediate-depth events (70–300 km, within subducting slabs) should be shielded from surface mass redistribution. If the equinox signal persists at intermediate depths, a surface-loading mechanism is insufficient.

**Reframe reason:** Zhan & Shearer (2015) found that 70% of deep-focus M > 7 earthquakes (depth > 500 km) occurred in April–September — a suggestive seasonal signal in deep events with no known surface mechanism. This directly inverts the original null prediction at depth: the literature now hints that large deep events may show *more* seasonality, not less. This makes depth stratification a much richer test than simply checking whether shallow signal exceeds deep signal.

## Revised Test

Stratify the catalog by focal depth: shallow (0–20 km), mid-crustal (20–70 km), intermediate (70–300 km), and deep (> 300 km if sample permits). Compute solar-phase distributions for each band. Test whether signal amplitude increases, decreases, or is non-monotonic with depth.

## Revised Predictions

- **Surface loading hypothesis:** Signal strongest at 0–20 km; absent or greatly reduced at > 70 km.
- **Geometric/deep forcing hypothesis:** Signal present at all depth ranges including > 300 km.
- **Zhan & Shearer pattern:** Deep events show seasonality, but potentially with different phase than shallow events — a finding of independent interest.
