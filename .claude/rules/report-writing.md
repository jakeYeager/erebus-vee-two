# Report Writing Rules

## Document Structure
- Numbered sections; you may expand as needed to include relevant content within subsections (i.e. related cross-topic content) that improves readability and interpretation: 
  - Abstract
  - Data Source (brief sample description)
  - Methodology 
  - Results 
  - Interpretation or Summary
  - Limitations
  - References (as applicable)

## Template Header & Footers

Use these template header and footers unless otherwise specified:

**Header:**
```markdown
# Case [identifier]: [Title]

**Document Information**
- Version: 1.0
- Date: [current date]
```

**Footer:**
```markdown
---

**Generation Details**
- Version: 1.0
- Date: [current date]
- Generated with: Claude Code ([current model used])
```

## Images

Any data visualization image should be embedded inline (once) within their referencing section.


## Update Version on Content Change

When updating a report or whitepaper that has a "Version" number in the header or footer, increment the version as qualitatively appropriate. There are no specific standards for incrementing unless directly specified.

## Interpretive Analysis Standards

In any interpretive or summary statements remain as objective as possible. Guard against both confirmation bias as well as hypothesis bias (interpreting results based primarily on popular or conventional scientific discourse).
