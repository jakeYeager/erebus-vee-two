# Case B3: Tectonic Regime Stratification

> **Verdict: KEEP — reframed with additional motivation**

## Motivation

Different fault geometries respond differently to changes in normal stress and Coulomb stress. Thrust faults (compression) are clamped by surface loading; normal faults (extension) are unclamped by the same loading. Strike-slip faults are intermediate. If the equinox signal is stress-loading driven, its phase and amplitude should differ systematically by fault mechanism.

**Reframe addition:** Métivier et al. (2009) found slightly greater tidal triggering in normal and strike-slip regions than thrust regions at the global scale — establishing a fault-mechanism baseline for periodic forcing sensitivity. This provides a reference pattern: if the annual solar signal matches the Métivier tidal pattern (normal > strike-slip > thrust), it suggests a similar stress-change geometry even at annual timescales. If it differs, a distinct mechanism is implied.

## Test

Classify events by focal mechanism type (thrust, normal, strike-slip) using the GCMT catalog. Compute solar-phase distributions for each class separately. Test for differences in phase, amplitude, and significance.

## Novel Contribution

No published study has stratified an annual solar seismicity signal by tectonic regime at global scale. Regional studies (Nepal thrust, California strike-slip) have been done separately but never compared within a single unified framework.

## Predictions

- **Loading hypothesis:** Thrust faults show solstice deficits; normal faults show solstice excess; patterns approximately anti-phased.
- **Geometric hypothesis:** All three classes show equinox excess with similar phase.
- **Consistent with Métivier tidal pattern:** Normal and strike-slip show stronger signal than thrust.
