## Purpose
The purpose of this project is for the user to begin to formally describe and document novel seismic phenomena they have more informally observed, by using rigorous, reproducible statistical validation. It is also for the user to explore how to leverage generative AI tools for academic research in the seismology and data analysis domain.
