# Topic: Seasonal Solar Signal Investigation

**Status: Initial Case Planning**

## Intent

The bimodal equinox pattern is not straightforwardly explained by the dominant mechanism in the literature (hydrological/snow loading). Hydrological forcing peaks at summer or winter solstice depending on hemisphere and regional climate — not at the equinoxes. The equinox signal is more consistent with a direct solar-geometric forcing (e.g., solar declination rate of change, Earth-Sun distance, or tidal stress geometry) or with a globally symmetric effect that cancels hemisphere-specific hydrological loading and leaves a residual equinox peak. This distinction is the core scientific question.

## Case Review Priority

Review the cases in the following priority:
1. A4: Declustering sensitivity
2. B6: Rolling window stationarity
3. A1: Schuster / MFPA spectrum
4. B1: Hemisphere phase symmetry
5. A3: Magnitude stratification
6. B2: Ocean vs. continent
7. B4: Depth stratification
8. A2: b-value seasonality
9. B3: Tectonic regime
10. B5: Declination rate vs. position
