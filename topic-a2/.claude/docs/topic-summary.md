# Topic Summary

## Case A4: Declustering Sensitivity Analysis
**Status:** Complete
**Key results:** Raw χ²=69.37 (p=1.52×10⁻⁶, k=24); G-K mainshocks χ²=32.08 (p=0.098, 53.75% suppression); Reasenberg mainshocks χ²=39.94 (p=0.016, 42.43% suppression); A1b mainshocks χ²=30.41 (p=0.138, 56.16% suppression). Interval survival (k=24): Interval 1 (~Mar equinox) absent under all methods; Intervals 2 (~Aug) and 3 (~Nov) survive under all three methods. Aftershock phase preference: all three aftershock populations are highly significant (G-K: χ²=66.35, p=4.4×10⁻⁶; Reas: χ²=107.37, p=7.3×10⁻¹³; A1b: χ²=111.35, p=1.5×10⁻¹³) with classification "significant, intervals match A1b baseline" for all three methods.

## Case B6: Rolling Window Stationarity Test
**Status:** Complete
**Key results:** Classification: non-stationary. 24/62 windows (38.7%) significant at p<0.05 on Rayleigh test (0 survive Bonferroni correction, threshold p<0.000806). Circular std of window mean phases: 84.4° (threshold >40° for non-stationary). Rayleigh R range: 0.0067–0.0670 (mean 0.0439). 1970s anomaly ratio: 1.009 (not flagged; threshold >1.5). Chi-square (k=24) significant in 44/62 windows (71.0%), diverging from Rayleigh count, suggesting multi-modal rather than unimodal distributional departures. Most significant windows cluster in 2003–2014 start-year range. Signal is temporally intermittent, which conditions interpretation of downstream mechanistic cases.

## Case A1: Schuster Spectrum and MFPA Periodicity Analysis
**Status:** Complete
**Key results:** No significant cluster-robust Schuster signal at annual (365.25d) for any catalog (raw p_cr=0.945, G-K p_cr=0.812, A1b p_cr=0.624). Raw half-year standard Schuster p=1.46×10⁻³ reduced to p_cr=0.482 after cluster correction (329-fold inflation by aftershock clustering). No significant MFPA signal at 365.25d. Strongest MFPA detection: ~75.6d (quarter-year), power=21.6 (raw), 7.4 (G-K), 6.2 (A1b), all p_mfpa≤0.001; consistent with Interval 1 only (Mar equinox region), not with the full three-interval structure. Total MFPA significant periods (>p95): raw=53, G-K=24, A1b=17 (55–68% reduction with declustering). No harmonic pattern found that simultaneously predicts all three A1b intervals. Cluster reduction at 1-day threshold: raw 37.2%, G-K 21.9%, A1b 25.6%.

## Case B1: Hemisphere Stratification — Phase Symmetry Test
**Status:** Complete
**Key results:** NH n=4,429; SH n=4,781; n_equatorial=0. NH k=24: χ²=73.13 (p=3.96×10⁻⁷, V=0.0268); SH k=24: χ²=47.34 (p=2.03×10⁻³, V=0.0207). Test 1 (global symmetry): partially symmetric — intervals 2 and 3 in both hemispheres; interval 1 (March equinox) in NH only. Test 2 (interval 1): NH=True, SH=False (SH overlap 33%, below 50% threshold). Test 3 (intervals 2 & 3): both appear in both hemispheres at same phase positions. Test 4 (half-cycle offset): found (NH interval at ~0.396 ↔ SH interval at ~0.896, offset=0.500; 1 of 20 pairs within tolerance). Primary conclusion: hydrological (partially supported) — half-cycle offset detected, but intervals 2 and 3 are not hemisphere-specific as the hydrological hypothesis predicts.

## Case A3: Magnitude Stratification of the Solar Signal
**Status:** Complete
**Key results:** Band sizes: M 6.0–6.4 (n=6,482), M 6.5–6.9 (n=1,880), M 7.0–7.4 (n=577), M ≥ 7.5 (n=271). Cramér's V at k=24: M 6.0–6.4=0.0186, M 6.5–6.9=0.0292, M 7.0–7.4=0.0450, M ≥ 7.5=0.0779. Spearman ρ (Cramér's V vs band): 1.000 (p≈0) — perfect monotonic increase. Trend classification: increasing. Significant bands at k=24 (p<0.05): M 6.0–6.4 (p=5.4×10⁻⁴), M 6.5–6.9 (p=0.034), M ≥ 7.5 (p=0.027); M 7.0–7.4 not significant (p=0.260). Prediction support: hydrological_loading=not supported; solar_geometric=supported; tidal_literature_pattern=not supported; magnitude_independent=not supported. Max/min V ratio=4.18.
