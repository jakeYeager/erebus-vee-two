# Data Source

Unless specifically stated otherwise data useed in this project was collected from the USGS ComCat catalog. Collection and enrichment of astronomical metrics using the JPL DE421 ephemeris was done with https://github.com/jakeYeager/nornir-urd-two.

## Data Quality - USGS ComCat

Global catalog datasets of >=M6.0 can show a dramatic increase in the number of records >M6.0 around 1950 (no exact date yet determined). The cause has not yet been identified within this body of work (USGS network expansion/funding changes?) but any dataset within these parameters should be considered incomplete.

Likewise for global datasets >=M4.0 can show a dramatic increase in the number of records 4.0>=M=<5.9 around 1973 (no exact date or reason yet determined).
