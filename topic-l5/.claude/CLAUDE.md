# Effects of Declustering Seismic Data Samples in Analysis (legacy Approach Five)

## Intent

This approach focuses on the effects of declustering seismic data samples in their analysis using known lawfullness.

## Data Description

Global seismicity M≥6.0, post-1949, n=9,802 (pre-declustering); G-K declustered: 6,222 mainshocks / 3,580 aftershocks
