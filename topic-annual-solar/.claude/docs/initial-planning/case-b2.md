# Case B2: Ocean vs. Continent Location — Hydrological Loading Discrimination

> **Verdict: KEEP**

## Motivation

Hydrological and snow loading mechanisms are land-surface processes. Oceanic earthquakes (mid-ocean ridges, subduction zones distant from continental hydrology) should not be subject to significant hydrological Coulomb stress changes. If the equinox signal persists in purely oceanic seismicity, hydrological loading is not a sufficient explanation.

The tidal literature adds relevant context: Scholz et al. (2019) found strong tidal modulation at Axial Volcano (mid-ocean ridge), demonstrating that oceanic/volcanic settings can show periodic signals via different mechanisms than continental hydrology. A positive oceanic result would therefore require careful mechanism discrimination.

## Test

Classify events using a distance-to-coastline threshold (e.g., > 200 km offshore = oceanic, < 50 km or on-continent = continental). Compute the solar-phase bin distribution for each subset. Test whether the equinox signal appears in both, only one, or neither.

## Novel Contribution

No published study has used ocean/continent separation as a mechanism discriminator for annual solar seismicity at global scale.

## Predictions

- **Geometric hypothesis:** Equinox signal appears in both oceanic and continental subsets.
- **Hydrological hypothesis:** Signal is confined to or significantly stronger in continental earthquakes.
