# Data Visualization Rules

- PNG format, 300+ DPI suitable for publication
- Include titles, axis labels, legends, statistical annotations
- Prefer visuals in PNG or SVG formats for displaying complex data
- ASCII diagrams should be avoided unless they are simple file structure charts or workflow/decision charts
- For histograms and bar charts use `steelblue` as the default bar color
- Never use named two-tone scales like `viridis`
- When using gradient/two-tone scales in a graphic (heatmaps, density plots): Use a white=least, [color]=greatest scheme
   - Color for primary or full populations: Red (fallback to Orange)
   - Color for secondary or subpopulations: Blue, Purple, Green
