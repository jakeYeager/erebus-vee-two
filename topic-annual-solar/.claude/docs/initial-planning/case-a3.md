# Case A3: Magnitude Stratification of the Solar Signal

> **Verdict: KEEP — elevated priority**

## Motivation

The tidal literature review substantially reinforces this case. Métivier (2009) found tidal triggering shows inverse magnitude dependence (stronger for smaller events). Ide et al. (2016) found M < 8.2 indistinguishable from random for tidal phase. Hao et al. (2018) found diurnal periodicity stronger at larger magnitudes in Japan. These findings in opposite directions at different timescales make the magnitude-dependence of the annual solar signal a key discriminator: if the Case 3A signal concentrates in a specific magnitude band, that directly constrains the mechanism.

## Test

Stratify the catalog into magnitude bands (M 6.0–6.4, M 6.5–6.9, M 7.0–7.4, M >= 7.5). Compute chi-square, Rayleigh statistic, and Cramér's V for each band independently. Test whether effect size increases, decreases, or is flat with magnitude.

## Expected Outcomes

- **If hydrological loading is mechanism:** Effect should weaken or disappear for M >= 7.5.
- **If solar-geometric forcing is mechanism:** Effect is flat or increases with magnitude.
- **If consistent with tidal literature pattern:** Effect should be weakest at M >= 6 — making any positive result here a novel finding.
