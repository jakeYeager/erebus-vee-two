# Topic Adhoc: General Methodology and Architure Review

## Intent

The adhoc topic lives outside of the more formalized research topic workflow. It is intented to be a "generalized review" topic for the user. The user can then review the results of the individual cases to make decisions regarding the other more formal case testing suites within other topics.

## Workflow

The user will work with you on iterative refinements of a specification file until it is ready to execute.
