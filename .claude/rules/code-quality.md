# Code Quality Rules

- File naming convention is kebab-case: `file-name.md`
- Complex statistical calculations should be executed in a script or module which can be reviewed and serve as documentation
- Type hints on all functions
- Docstrings explaining purpose and parameters
- Error handling for data issues
- Logging for important steps
- Reproducible random seeds (if applicable)
